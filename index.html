    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      There are a couple of ways to do this. I would start to explain the most common security treats that is out there in short sentences:
    </p>
    <li>
      Cross-site scripting(XSS), a malicious script that has the potencial to steal the user information from their site. Or administrate the users account.
    </li>
    <li>
      SQL Injection, malicious data sent from the user side that can corrupt tha database or changing the behavior in the code to view userinformation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cross-site request forgery(XSRF), tricking users to click a link for a profitable gain.
    </li>
    <p>
      If the clients site does not have protection from these treats then it will definitely harm the client aswell as their users. It will harm the business at its whole, compromising its reputation and trust. To stop this, there are some services i would recommend to build in their website.
    </p>
    <ol>
      1. Using a well known third party html package to sanitize the HTML code. I would also inform that most web frameworks today automatically sanitize input from users by default. The frameworks will also escape ` character, protecing from SQL injection attacks.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      2. Activate authentication for user login. This can be through an app or a sms when the user are going to log into their site.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      3. Impliment automatic user timeout, logging out the user after one given time of inactivity.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      4. Mitigate some attack by enabling HTTPS in their website address. To add this, a custom domain must be own. 
    </ol>
    <ol>
      5. Including user-specific site-generated secret in the POST requests.
    </ol>
